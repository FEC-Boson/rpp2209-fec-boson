Future enhancement:

1.3.6.4.   Upload your photos
A button will appear allowing users to upload their photos to the form.  Up to five photos should be allowed for each answer.
Clicking the button should open a separate window where the photo to be can be selected.
After the first image is uploaded, a thumbnail showing the image should appear.
A user should be able to add up to five images before the button to add disappears, preventing further additions.
