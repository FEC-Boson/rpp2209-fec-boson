Phase 0:
During this phase, we each were randomly assigned our app widgets. Guillermo Hasbun was assigned Product Overview, Harry Meng was assigned Ratings, Fig Fishkin was assigned Q&A, and Maddie Sime was assigned Related. The main portion of Phase 0 was spent delegating our duties as a team via the Business Requirements Document, and setting community standards for each team member to follow. We worked on understanding our Git Workflow, and created engineering journals to help keep track of our coding time and reflections.

Phase 1:
During this phase, we worked on our widget layouts and components. We began utilizing Trello more often to write tickets to render our app components, as well as structure our components in a cleaner organization style. Working on our branches as a group proved to be rocky at first, but communication was key to keeping us on track. This phase allowed each group member the ability to work on their respective component independently, but also ask for assistance for bugs and general guidance.
